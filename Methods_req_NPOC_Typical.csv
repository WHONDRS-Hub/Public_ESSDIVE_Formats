NPOC_Typical,NPOC_T_IN_001,MethodID_Inspection,Vials were intact and filled to appropriate levels.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
NPOC_Typical,NPOC_T_ST_001,MethodID_Storage,Sediment was stored at -80C before and after lyophilization. Sediment extracts were stored at 4C in the dark for under 2 days until analyis.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
NPOC_Typical,NPOC_T_PRES_001,MethodID_Preservation,No preservatives added.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
NPOC_Typical,NPOC_T_PREP_001,MethodID_Preparation,Sediments were lyophilized for 3 days. Stored at -80 degC until extraction day. 10 grams of sediment and 20 mL of Milli-Q water were added to a proteomic friendly falcon tube; put on an Inova 2100 shaker at 375 rpms for 2 hours; and centrifuged at 6000 rcf for 5 minutes. 1.4 mL of the extracted supernatant was filtered (0.2 um Sterivex filter) and pipetted into analysis vial and diluted with Milli-Q water to a final volume of 7 mL.,Inova 2100 shaker,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
NPOC_Typical,NPOC_T_AN_001,MethodID_Analysis,Best 3 of 5 injections; injection vol: 150 uL; furnace temp 680 degC; std concentration ranges 0.25-100 mg/L C; Shimadzu TOC-L,Shimadzu TOC-L CPH/CPN with a TNM-L,Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
NPOC_Typical,NPOC_T_DP_001,MethodID_DataProcessing,Data evaluated for whether values were within +/- 10% of standard curve. If not then values were replaced with "Below_Range" or "Above_Range" text. If any sample had fewer than 3 injections then sample values are replaced with "Too_Few_Injections". If there were more than 3 injections - the 3 that were closest to each other were retained; the others were dropped. For each sample - the ratio of maximum to minimum Areas within the remaining 3 injections was found and if the ratio was greater than 2 - the reported concentration is given as "Injections_Too_Variable.",N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
