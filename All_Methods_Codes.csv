Moisture_Typical,MOIS_T_AN_000,MethodID_Analysis,Vial was weighed then dried in 105 degC oven for 48 hours or 24 hours. If 48 hours: drying was complete after 48 hours. If 24 hours: several vials from the same oven batch were weighed again after drying; placed in the oven again for 3 hours; then weighed again. If there was no significant change to mass then analysis of all vials in oven was complete. If the mass changed then vials were put in oven again for an additional 24h until there was no mass change.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory

NPOC_Typical,NPOC_T_PREP_001,MethodID_Preparation,Sediments were lyophilized for 3 days. Stored at -80 degC until extraction day. 10 grams of sediment and 20 mL of Milli-Q water were added to a proteomic friendly falcon tube; put on an Inova 2100 shaker at 375 rpms for 2 hours; and centrifuged at 6000 rcf for 5 minutes. 1.4 mL of the extracted supernatant was filtered (0.2 um Sterivex filter) and pipetted into analysis vial and diluted with Milli-Q water to a final volume of 7 mL.,Inova 2100 shaker,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
NPOC_Typical,NPOC_T_AN_001,MethodID_Analysis,Best 3 of 5 injections; injection vol: 150 uL; furnace temp 680 degC; std concentration ranges 0.25-100 mg/L C; Shimadzu TOC-L,Shimadzu TOC-L CPH/CPN with a TNM-L,Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
NPOC_Typical,NPOC_T_DP_001,MethodID_DataProcessing,Data evaluated for whether values were within +/- 10% of standard curve. If not then values were replaced with "Below_Range" or "Above_Range" text. If any sample had fewer than 3 injections then sample values are replaced with "Too_Few_Injections". If there were more than 3 injections - the 3 that were closest to each other were retained; the others were dropped. For each sample - the ratio of maximum to minimum Areas within the remaining 3 injections was found and if the ratio was greater than 2 - the reported concentration is given as "Injections_Too_Variable.",N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
TN_Typical,TN_T_IN_001,MethodID_Inspection,Vials were intact and filled to appropriate levels.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory

NPOC_RERUN,NPOCRERUN_001,MethodID_Analysis,Sample was re-run because it fell outside of the calibration curve. An additional dilution was made from the leftover sample from the first try.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
NPOC_Blanks,NPOC_BLANK_000,MethodID_Preparation,For extraction process-blanks. 20 mL of Milli-Q water were added to a proteomic friendly falcon tube; put on an Inova 2100 shaker at 375 rpms for 2 hours; and centrifuged at 6000 rcf for 5 minutes. 7 mL of the MilliQ in the tube was filtered (0.2 um Sterivex filter) and pipetted into analysis vial.,Inova 2100 shaker,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
